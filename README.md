The UnboundEd LCMS is a specialized content management system for high quality
education materials. It incorporates two primary web-based components; an end-user interface to allow educators and other consumers to browse, search, and export educational materials available through the site, and an administrative interface that allows users with permissions to import content into the site from a variety of sources and manage the existing content library.

## Setup
