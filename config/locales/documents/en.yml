      <p>If there’s not sufficient time to deliver the lesson in one 60 minute sitting, the lesson can be broken up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introducing the Read-Aloud up to—but not including—Purpose for Listening (~10-15 minutes)</li>
        <li>Purpose for Listening, Presenting the Read-Aloud, and Discussing the Read-Aloud (~25-30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Work Time (~20 minutes)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Pacing guidance is not applicable when lesson adaptations are made</p>
    ela_2_m1_u8_html: >
      <p>Introducing the Read-Aloud and Work Time may have activity options that exceed the time allocated for that part of the lesson. To remain within the time periods allocated for each portion of the lesson, you will need to make conscious choices about which activities to include based on the needs of your students.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teacher can do a minimally scaffolded version of the lesson and then the students who need support get specific skill work using text from the lesson in a later class period (that teacher would pull out the activities for scaffolding that were not done from the ELA class)</li>
        <li>The teacher can do the lesson over a period of two days (45 minute classes) using all of the embedded scaffolds</li>
        <li>The teacher can do the lesson in one day (90 minute class)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>This lesson is paced for a 45-minute time period. Teacher may reference adaptation guidance at the unit-level page to make pacing adjustment based on needs for scaffolding student reading, writing, listening, and speaking in order to meet the grade-level standards.</p>
